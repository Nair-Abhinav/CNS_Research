    "This encryption algorithm introduces a novel approach to securing plaintext by leveraging the principles of **graph coloring**. It constructs a randomized graph based on a derived cryptographic key using PBKDF2 with salt. The nodes of the graph represent ASCII characters, and edges are randomly assigned. The algorithm employs a greedy graph-coloring strategy to assign colors to nodes, where each color serves as a cryptographic parameter. During encryption, each character of the plaintext is encoded into a tuple comprising its assigned color, a computed parameter, and a dynamically generated salt value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The encrypted data is serialized and further protected using an XOR-based encryption scheme with the derived key, followed by the integration of an HMAC for integrity verification. Decryption involves reconstructing the graph and its coloring scheme to map the ciphertext back to plaintext. This graph-theoretic approach ensures robust encryption by introducing non-linear transformations and structural randomness, offering enhanced security while maintaining computational efficiency.  \n",
